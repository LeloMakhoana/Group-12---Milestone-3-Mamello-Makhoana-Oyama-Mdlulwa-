        <h1>Welcome to Empowering the Nation!</h1>
        <p class="text-right">At Empowering the Nation, we think everyone should have the chance to advance their</p>
        <p>Careers and develop their skill sets. Our program, started in 2018 by Precious Radebe, aims to give</p> 
          <p>Johannesburg's gardeners and housekeepers access to top-notch vocational training. By providing courses</p>
          <p>that increase a person's marketability, allow them to command greater salaries, or perhaps launch their </p>
          <p>own business, we hope to improve our community.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
      
          
          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p class="text-left">
          Our goal at Empowering the Nation is based on a strong sense of community service. By offering easily 
          accessible and excellent skill training, we hope to empower peopleâ€”especially those from underprivileged
          backgrounds. We think that regardless of background or circumstances, every individual deserves the 
          opportunity to develop, learn, and succeed. 
<br>
<br>
           Our goal is to improve not only the lives of people but also those of their families and communities
           through our thoughtfully crafted courses. We create a supportive, welcoming environment where students 
           may grow in self-assurance, acquire necessary skills, and reach their greatest potential. We are here to
           help every learner along the way by offering direction and inspiration at every turn.
           
           <br>
           <br>
           We at Empowering 
           the Nation see a day when everyone is able to better their lot in life and realize their dreams. One 
           skill at a time, we can collectively create a community that is stronger and more empowered.</p>
