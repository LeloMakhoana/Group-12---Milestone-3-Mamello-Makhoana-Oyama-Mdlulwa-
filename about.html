        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>Precious Radebe established Empowering the Nation in 2018 out of a sincere desire to improve her 
          neighbourhood. <br>Precious realized there was a critical need for easily accessible training programs 
          for gardeners and domestic workers after seeing <br>firsthand the difficulties encountered by her family 
          and numerous others who were never allowed to further their education or acquire <br>new skills.Empowering 
          the Nation—a ray of empowerment and hope for people looking to change their lives—was thus formed.</p>
